We have three datasets to work with. One dataset is linearly seperable that means all the classes can be seperated using linear lines. Second dataset is Non-Linearly Seperable dataset that means we should get non linear decision boundaries between each class. Third dataset is Linearly Non Seperable dataset it means data cannot be seperated using linear lines.
