In this assignment we generated HMM models for different number of symbols and states and trained them on digits 1, 2 and 3 and characters a, tA and dA for the respective questions. After testing them independently we then connected them to recognize the connected strings. We also did the recognition task using DTW method. One of the mistakes that we were doing was to do K-Means on the test data again for assigning cluster labels.
