There are two files: 
Question_3.ipynb and Question_4_b.ipynb

Question_3.ipynb is the code for Question_3 and Question_4_b.ipynb is the code for Question_4_b.

To run the code just load the .ipynb files in the Jupyter notebook in the browser and run the code cell by cell.
The plots will be generated inline in the browser.
